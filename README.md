# applycl
applycl is a pretty simple "Configuration manager" of sorts to ensure that files exist and packages
are installed on an Arch Linux system. This is a work and progress and I will be adding more features
to try and make a 'real' configuration manager. Right now it only ensures packages are installed,
and files exist.


Obviously this is super hacky and really just something I'm doing to learn lisp, but if it ends up
being half useful then awesome. But don't expect anything :)
